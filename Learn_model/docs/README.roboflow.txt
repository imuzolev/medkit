Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 442 images.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14 are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 512x512 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, upside-down
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -17 and +17 percent
